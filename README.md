# Digital-Clock
The Digital Clock project is a simple yet functional timekeeping system that displays the current time in a digital format (HH:MM:SS). It updates every second and provides a real-time display of hours, minutes, and seconds. This project helps understand the concepts of time management, real-time operations, and user interface design.
